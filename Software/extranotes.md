## Cuphead
- The game automatically sets itself to a high resolution, so you will want to change it to a lower resolution to avoid lag. To do this, go to settings>visuals and change resolution. The menu for changing resolution should look like this.

- You're likely going to have to remap your controls for 3D games, so we recommend just sticking to 2D and using the other emulators we've uploaded for 3d games.

## DOLPHIN
[Here's a video tutorial on how to use Dolphin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj2DyAD8_pg)

## 7ZIP
- 7Zip is a software that can zip up folders into an alternative zip file. Instead of the .zip extension it compresses to a .7z file. Although, both work we will sometimes use .7z files and you unzip these by first downloading 7zip from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1by7I72v0vP8VvdlOQaE5SnwC3zSoam6z/view?usp=sharing). After that you can double click on the .7z and you will be greeted with this.

- Once you see that, click extract then choose a destination. The destination is where the unpacked files will be deposited. After unpacking you will have a file folder.
